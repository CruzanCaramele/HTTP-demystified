class webServerHandler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
	""" it extends from the BaseHTTPRequestHandler class """

	def do_GET(self):
		""" this function handles all GET requests for the web server. In this case, the function will pattern matching plan to determine which resource is being accessed.This will look for the ending of the URL pattern. """

		try:
			""" the BaseHTTPRequestHandler provides a variable called path that contains the URL sent by the client to the server as a string. Here we will look for a string the ends with /hello """
			if self.path.endswith("/hello"):
		except Exception as e:
			raise e
