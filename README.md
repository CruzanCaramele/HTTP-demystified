#Restaurant

This is a small project demonstrating the use of the BaseHTTPServer class to create an HTTP web server that performs [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) operations. 

The goal of this project is to use Python code to explain how the webserver uses GET and POST operations to perform operations on a sqlite database.
